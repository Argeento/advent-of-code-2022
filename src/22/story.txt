Monkey Map

The monkeys take you on a surprisingly easy trail through the jungle. They're even going in roughly the right direction according to your handheld device's Grove Positioning System.

As you walk, the monkeys explain that the grove is protected by a force field. To pass through the force field, you have to enter a password; doing so involves tracing a specific path on a strangely-shaped board.

At least, you're pretty sure that's what you have to do; the elephants aren't exactly fluent in monkey.

The monkeys give you notes that they took when they last saw the password entered
