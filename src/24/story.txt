Blizzard Basin
---
With everything replanted for next year (and with elephants and monkeys to tend the grove), you and the Elves leave for the extraction point.

Partway up the mountain that shields the grove is a flat, open area that serves as the extraction point. It's a bit of a climb, but nothing the expedition can't handle.

At least, that would normally be true; now that the mountain is covered in snow, things have become more difficult than the Elves are used to.

As the expedition reaches a valley that must be traversed to reach the extraction site, you find that strong, turbulent winds are pushing small blizzards of snow and sharp ice around the valley. It's a good thing everyone packed warm clothes! To make it across safely, you'll need to find a way to avoid them.
