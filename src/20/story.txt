Grove Positioning System
---
It's finally time to meet back up with the Elves. When you try to contact them, however, you get no reply. Perhaps you're out of range?

You know they're headed to the grove where the star fruit grows, so if you can figure out where that is, you should be able to meet back up with them.

Fortunately, your handheld device has a file (your puzzle input) that contains the grove's coordinates! Unfortunately, the file is encrypted - just in case the device were to fall into the wrong hands.

Maybe you can decrypt it?
