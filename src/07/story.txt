No Space Left On Device
---
You can hear birds chirping and raindrops hitting leaves as the expedition proceeds. Occasionally, you can even hear much louder sounds in the distance; how big do the animals get out here, anyway?

The device the Elves gave you has problems with more than just its communication system. You try to run a system update:

```bash
$ system-update --please --pretty-please-with-sugar-on-top
Error: No space left on device
```
Perhaps you can delete some files to make space for the update?
